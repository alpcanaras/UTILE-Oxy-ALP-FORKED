# *UTILE-Oxy* - Deep Learning to Automate Video Analysis of Bubble

Dynamics in Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolyzers
We present  an automated workflow using deep learning for the analysis of videos containing oxygen bubbles in PEM electrolyzers by: 1. preparing annotated dataset and training models in order to conduct semantic seg- mentation of bubbles and 2. automating the extraction of bubble properties for further distribution analysis.
