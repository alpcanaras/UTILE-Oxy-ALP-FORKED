# UTILE-Oxy
We present  an automated workflow using deep learning for the analysis of videos containing oxygen bubbles in PEM electrolyzers by: 1. preparing annotated dataset and training models in order to conduct semantic seg- mentation of bubbles and 2. automating the extraction of bubble properties for further distribution analysis.
